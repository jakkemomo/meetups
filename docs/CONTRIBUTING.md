# Contributing to Meetups

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Meetups. This document explains our contribution process and procedures:

* [Development Workflow](#Development-Workflow)
* [Coding Style](#Coding-Style)

## Development Workflow

### Branch naming

Each new branch should be named in the following format   
`<feature|fix|test>/<username>/<short description>`

For example:  
 - New branch with bug fix can be names as:  
 `fix/sakalex/wrong-static-path`
 - Or branch with new feature can be named as:
 `feature/sakalex/add-user-login`

### Commit message structure

- Every commit message should contains link to github issue or clickup task.
- The commit message must be meaningful.

For example:  
 ```
 [862kmyn0c] - Add an Apache v2.0 licence.
 ```  
 Or   
 ```
 [Issue 1] - Fix issue 1

 https://github.com/jakkemomo/meetups/issues/1
 - Fix first part of an issue
 - Fix second part of and issue
 ```
